Therefore, no inbound traffic originating from another host to your instance is allowed until you add inbound rules to the security group. By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific outbound traffic only. If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic originating from your instance is allowed.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Open the custom port on the Security Group. Your EC2 instances will be able to use this port after 60 minutes</strong> and <strong>Open the custom port on the Network Access Control List of your VPC.

Your EC2 instances will be able to use this port immediately</strong> is incorrect because the scenario says that VPC is using a default configuration. Since by default, Network ACL allows <strong>all</strong> inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic, then there is no point of explicitly allowing the port in the Network ACL. Security Groups, on the other hand, does not allow incoming traffic by default, unlike Network ACL.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon VPC Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-vpc/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-vpc/</a></p></div>"

Batch jobs are often short-lived and embarrassingly parallel. You can package your batch processing application into a Docker image so that you can deploy it anywhere, such as in an Amazon ECS task.</p><p>Amazon ECS supports batch jobs. You can use Amazon ECS <em>Run Task</em> action to run one or more tasks once. The Run Task action starts the ECS task on an instance that meets the task’s requirements including CPU, memory, and ports.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/ecs-refarch-batch-processing/raw/master/images/ECSBatchRefArch.png\"></p><p>For example, you can set up an ECS Batch architecture for an image processing application. You can set up an AWS CloudFormation template that creates an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon SQS queue, an Amazon CloudWatch alarm, an ECS cluster, and an ECS task definition. Objects uploaded to the input S3 bucket trigger an event that sends object details to the SQS queue. The ECS task deploys a Docker container that reads from that queue, parses the message containing the object name and then downloads the object. Once transformed it will upload the objects to the S3 output bucket.</p><p>By using the SQS queue as the location for all object details, you can take advantage of its scalability and reliability as the queue will automatically scale based on the incoming messages and message retention can be configured. The ECS Cluster will then be able to scale services up or down based on the number of messages in the queue.</p><p>You have to create an IAM Role that the ECS task assumes in order to get access to the S3 buckets and SQS queue. Note that the permissions of the IAM role don't specify the S3 bucket ARN for the incoming bucket. This is to avoid a circular dependency issue in the CloudFormation template. You should always make sure to assign the least amount of privileges needed to an IAM role.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong><em>Launch a new Amazon SQS queue and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS tasks can assume in order to get access to the S3 buckets and SQS queue. Declare the IAM Role (</em></strong><code><strong><em>taskRoleArn</em></strong></code><strong><em>) in the task definition.</em></strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a new Amazon AppStream 2.0 queue and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS tasks can assume in order to get access to the S3 buckets and AppStream 2.0 queue. Declare the IAM Role (</em></strong><code><strong><em>taskRoleArn</em></strong></code><strong><em>) in the task definition</em></strong> is incorrect because Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed application streaming service and can't be used as a queue. You have to use Amazon SQS instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a new Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS tasks can assume in order to get access to the S3 buckets and Kinesis Data Firehose. Specify the ARN of the IAM Role in the (</em></strong><code><strong><em>taskDefinitionArn</em></strong></code><strong><em>) field of the task definition</em></strong> is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data. Although it can stream data to an S3 bucket, it is not suitable to be used as a queue for a batch application in this scenario. In addition, the ARN of the IAM Role should be declared in the <code>taskRoleArn</code> and not in the <code>taskDefinitionArn</code> field.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a new Amazon MQ queue and configure the second ECS task to read from it.

Snowball can also be the right choice if you don’t want to make expensive upgrades to your network infrastructure, if you frequently experience large backlogs of data, if you're located in a physically isolated environment, or if you're in an area where high-speed Internet connections are not available or cost-prohibitive.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, if it takes more than one week to upload your data to AWS using the spare capacity of your existing Internet connection, then you should consider using Snowball.

In addition, the scenario didn't warrant an establishment of a dedicated connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. The primary goal is to just do a one-time migration of data to AWS which can be accomplished by using AWS Snowball devices.</p><p><strong><em>Using AWS Snowmobile to transfer the data over to S3</em> </strong>is incorrect because Snowmobile is more suitable if you need to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS or need to transfer up to 100PB of data. This will be transported on a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck.

You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking. After you create a hosted zone for your domain, such as example.com, you create records to tell the Domain Name System (DNS) how you want traffic to be routed for that domain.</p><p>For example, you might create records that cause DNS to do the following:</p><p>Route internet traffic for example.com to the IP address of a host in your data center.</p><p>Route email for that domain (jose.rizal@tutorialsdojo.com) to a mail server (mail.tutorialsdojo.com).</p><p>Route traffic for a subdomain called operations.manila.tutorialsdojo.com to the IP address of a different host.</p><p>Each record includes the name of a domain or a subdomain, a record type (for example, a record with a type of MX routes email), and other information applicable to the record type (for MX records, the hostname of one or more mail servers and a priority for each server).</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/traffic-flow-geoproximity-map-example-no-bias.png\"></p><p>Route 53 has different routing policies that you can choose from.

It does not, however, guarantee that users in the same geographic region will be served from the same location.</p><p><strong>Geoproximity Routing</strong> lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a <em>bias</em>. A <strong>bias </strong>expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.</p><p><strong>Geolocation Routing</strong> lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from.</p><p><strong>Weighted Routing</strong> lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (tutorialsdojo.com) or subdomain name (subdomain.tutorialsdojo.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource.</p><p>In the scenario, the problem requires a routing policy that will let Route 53 route traffic to specific instances based on the location of the instances and the users.

You can specify not to terminate the EBS volume when you terminate the EC2 instance during instance creation.</p><p>- EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production which means that you can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.</p><p>- Amazon EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms (AES-256)</p><p>- EBS Volumes offer 99.999% SLA.</p><p><br></p><p>The option that says: <strong>When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated on a separate AWS region to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component</strong> is incorrect because when you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated within that zone only, and not on a separate AWS region, to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>EBS volumes can be attached to any EC2 Instance in any Availability Zone</strong> is incorrect as EBS volumes can only be attached to an EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume and write a copy of the data in the volume to Amazon RDS, where it is stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones</strong> is almost correct.

You can store and control access to these secrets centrally by using the Secrets Manager console, the Secrets Manager command line interface (CLI), or the Secrets Manager API and SDKs.</p><p>In the past, when you created a custom application that retrieves information from a database, you typically had to embed the credentials (the secret) for accessing the database directly in the application. When it came time to rotate the credentials, you had to do much more than just create new credentials. You had to invest time to update the application to use the new credentials. Then you had to distribute the updated application. If you had multiple applications that shared credentials and you missed updating one of them, the application would break. Because of this risk, many customers have chosen not to regularly rotate their credentials, which effectively substitutes one risk for another.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/images/ASM-Basic-Scenario.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code (including passwords), with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. This helps ensure that the secret can't be compromised by someone examining your code, because the secret simply isn't there. Also, you can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to a schedule that you specify. This enables you to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, which helps to significantly reduce the risk of compromise.</p><p>Hence, the most appropriate solution for this scenario is: <strong><em>Use AWS Secrets Manager to store and encrypt the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. Enable automatic rotation for all of the credentials.</em></strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Store the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets to Systems Manager Parameter Store each with a </em></strong><code><strong><em>SecureString</em></strong></code><strong><em> data type. The credentials are automatically rotated by default</em> </strong>is incorrect because Systems Manager Parameter Store doesn't rotate its parameters by default.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Store the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets to AWS ACM</em></strong> is incorrect because it is just a managed private CA service that helps you easily and securely manage the lifecycle of your private certificates to allow SSL communication to your application. This is not a suitable service to store database or any other confidential credentials.</p><p>The option that says:<em> </em><strong><em>Store the database credentials, API keys, and other secrets in AWS KMS</em></strong> is incorrect because this only makes it easy for you to create and manage encryption keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services. This is primarily used for encryption and not for hosting your credentials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/\">https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-securely-provide-database-credentials-to-lambda-functions-by-using-aws-secrets-manager/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-securely-provide-database-credentials-to-lambda-functions-by-using-aws-secrets-manager/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Secrets Manager Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-secrets-manager/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-secrets-manager/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Systems Manager Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-systems-manager/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-systems-manager/</a></p></div>"

Applications created using the EC2/On-Premises compute platform can be composed of executable files, configuration files, images, and more. Deployments that use the EC2/On-Premises compute platform manage the way in which traffic is directed to instances by using an in-place or blue/green deployment type.</p><p><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Used to deploy applications that consist of an updated version of a Lambda function. AWS Lambda manages the Lambda function in a serverless compute environment made up of a high-availability compute structure. All administration of the compute resources is performed by AWS Lambda.</p><p><strong>Amazon ECS:</strong> Used to deploy an Amazon ECS containerized application as a task set. CodeDeploy performs a blue/green deployment by installing an updated version of the application as a new replacement task set.

DataSync eliminates or automatically handles many of these tasks, including scripting copy jobs, scheduling, and monitoring transfers, validating data, and optimizing network utilization.

You can use DataSync to migrate active data sets or archives to AWS, transfer data to the cloud for timely analysis and processing, or replicate data to AWS for business continuity. Getting started with DataSync is easy: deploy the DataSync agent, connect it to your file system, select your AWS storage resources, and start moving data between them.

Amazon Glacier is designed to store data that is infrequently accessed. Amazon Glacier enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS so that they don’t have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure detection and repair, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</p><p><strong>Storing cached session data</strong> is incorrect because this is the main use case for ElastiCache and not Amazon Glacier.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Used for active database storage</strong> is incorrect because you should use RDS or DynamoDB for your active database storage as S3, in general, is used for storing your data or files.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Used as a data warehouse</strong> is incorrect because storing it for data warehousing is the main use case of Amazon Redshift. It does not meet the requirement of being able to archive your infrequently accessed data. You can use S3 standard instead for frequently accessed data or Glacier for infrequently accessed data and archiving.</p><p>It is advisable to transition the standard data to infrequent access first then transition it to Amazon Glacier. You can specify in the lifecycle rule the time it will sit in standard tier and infrequent access. You can also delete the objects after a certain amount of time.</p><p><img src=\"https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com/redactor/raw/2018-11-12_21-01-50-8e238b3286aa6c7c72f18b468ce19ead.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>In transitioning S3 standard to Glacier you need to tell S3 which objects are to be archived to the new Glacier storage option, and under what conditions. You do this by setting up a lifecycle rule using the following elements:</p><p>A prefix to specify which objects in the bucket are subject to the policy.</p><p>A relative or absolute time specifier and a time period for transitioning objects to Glacier. The time periods are interpreted with respect to the object’s creation date. They can be relative (migrate items that are older than a certain number of days) or absolute (migrate items on a specific date)</p><p>An object age at which the object will be deleted from S3. This is measured from the original PUT of the object into the service, and the clock is not reset by a transition to Glacier.</p><p><br></p><p>You can create a lifecycle rule in the AWS Management Console.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Glacier Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-glacier/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-glacier/</a></p></div>"
