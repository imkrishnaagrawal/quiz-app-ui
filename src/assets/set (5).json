To securely serve this private content by using CloudFront, you can do the following:</p><p>- Require that your users access your private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.</p><p>- Require that your users access your Amazon S3 content by using CloudFront URLs, not Amazon S3 URLs. Requiring CloudFront URLs isn't necessary, but it is recommended to prevent users from bypassing the restrictions that you specify in signed URLs or signed cookies. You can do this by setting up an origin access identity (OAI) for your Amazon S3 bucket. You can also configure the custom headers for a private HTTP server or an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint.</p><p>All objects and buckets by default are private. The pre-signed URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions. You can generate a pre-signed URL programmatically using the AWS SDK for Java or the AWS SDK for .NET.

For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query traffic.</p><p>Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate instance or group of instances based on your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com/redactor/raw/2020-01-21_05-42-25-d8c9d3cf71ef799dc5fffa57e7e2928d.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>A <em>reader endpoint</em> for an Aurora DB cluster provides load-balancing support for read-only connections to the DB cluster. Use the reader endpoint for read operations, such as queries. By processing those statements on the read-only Aurora Replicas, this endpoint reduces the overhead on the primary instance. It also helps the cluster to scale the capacity to handle simultaneous <code>SELECT</code> queries, proportional to the number of Aurora Replicas in the cluster. Each Aurora DB cluster has one reader endpoint.</p><p>If the cluster contains one or more Aurora Replicas, the reader endpoint load-balances each connection request among the Aurora Replicas. In that case, you can only perform read-only statements such as <code>SELECT</code> in that session. If the cluster only contains a primary instance and no Aurora Replicas, the reader endpoint connects to the primary instance. In that case, you can perform write operations through the endpoint.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is to <strong>use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Use the built-in Cluster endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database</strong> is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint can perform write operations in the database such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handling production traffic but not suitable for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database operations that will be sent.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Enable Amazon Aurora Parallel Query </strong>is incorrect because this feature simply enables Amazon Aurora to push down and distribute the computational load of a single query across thousands of CPUs in Aurora's storage layer. Take note that it does not load balance all of the incoming read requests equally to the two Read Replicas. With Parallel Query, query processing is pushed down to the Aurora storage layer. The query gains a large amount of computing power, and it needs to transfer far less data over the network. In the meantime, the Aurora database instance can continue serving transactions with much less interruption. This way, you can run transactional and analytical workloads alongside each other in the same Aurora database, while maintaining high performance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create a new Network Load Balancer to evenly distribute the read queries to the Read Replicas of the Amazon Aurora database </strong>is incorrect because a Network Load Balancer is not the suitable service/component to use for this requirement since an NLB is primarily used to distribute traffic to servers, not Read Replicas. You have to use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database instead.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/parallel-query/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/parallel-query/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon Aurora Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-aurora/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-aurora/</a></p></div>"

AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that is available in two tiers: Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield Standard applies always-on detection and inline mitigation techniques, such as deterministic packet filtering and priority-based traffic shaping, to minimize application downtime and latency.</p><p>AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. You can use AWS WAF to define customizable web security rules that control which traffic accesses your web applications.

Object ownership is important for managing permissions using a bucket policy. For a bucket policy to apply to an object in the bucket, the object must be owned by the account that owns the bucket. You can also manage object permissions using the object's ACL. However, object ACLs can be difficult to manage for multiple objects, so it's a best practice to use the bucket policy as a centralized method for setting permissions.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/access-policy-ex2.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>To be sure that a destination account owns an S3 object copied from another account, grant the destination account the permissions to perform the cross-account copy.

For example, if you PUT to an existing key, a subsequent read might return the old data or the updated data, but it will never return corrupted or partial data. This usually happens if your application is using parallel requests on the same object.</p><p>Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within Amazon's data centers. If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored. However, information about the changes must replicate across Amazon S3, which can take some time, and so you might observe the following behaviors:</p><p>- A process writes a new object to Amazon S3 and immediately lists keys within its bucket. Until the change is fully propagated, the object might not appear in the list.</p><p>- A process replaces an existing object and immediately attempts to read it. Until the change is fully propagated, Amazon S3 might return the prior data.</p><p>- A process deletes an existing object and immediately attempts to read it.

Amazon S3 does not currently support Object Locking. If two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest timestamp wins. If this is an issue, you will need to build an object-locking mechanism into your application.</p><p>Updates are key-based; there is no way to make atomic updates across keys. For example, you cannot make the update of one key dependent on the update of another key unless you design this functionality into your application.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: <strong><em>The data analytics application is designed to fetch objects from the S3 bucket using parallel requests</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>The data analytics application is designed to fetch parts of objects from the S3 bucket using a range header</em></strong> is incorrect because using a Range header is primarily used to retrieve an object in parts and is unlikely the root cause on why the application is intermittently getting old data. Using the <code>Range</code> HTTP header in a GET request, you can retrieve a specific range of bytes in an object stored in Amazon S3. With this, you can resume fetching other parts of the object whenever your application is ready. This resumable download is useful when you need only portions of your object data. It is also useful where network connectivity is poor and you need to react to failures.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>The data analytics application is designed to use atomic updates across object keys</em></strong><em> </em>is incorrect because the update operations are key-based which means that there is no way to make atomic updates across keys. Hence, this is not the root cause of this issue.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>The data analytics application is designed to update its data with an object-locking mechanism</em></strong> is incorrect because an object-locking mechanism will actually safeguard the application from the issue of getting obsolete data and not the other way around. Moreover, Amazon S3 does not currently support Object Locking for concurrent updates. Take note that this is different from the Amazon S3 Object Lock feature which prevents an object from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. The scenario mentioned here is about two or more clients that are concurrently accessing and updating the same object at the same time.

You can use <em>placement groups</em> to influence the placement of a group of <em>interdependent</em> instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:</p><p><strong><em>Cluster</em></strong> – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.</p><p><strong><em>Partition</em></strong> – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p><p><strong><em>Spread</em></strong> – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.</p><p>Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group. To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/placement-group-cluster.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Partition placement groups can be used to deploy large distributed and replicated workloads, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks.

Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks. Spread placement groups provide access to distinct racks, and are therefore suitable for mixing instance types or launching instances over time.

A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Set up AWS Direct Connect connections across multiple Availability Zones for increased bandwidth throughput and more consistent network experience</em></strong> is incorrect because this is primarily used for hybrid architectures.

To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. You store this configuration in the <em>notification</em> subresource that is associated with a bucket. Amazon S3 provides an API for you to manage this subresource.</p><p>Amazon S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer. If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent. If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket.

For example, if the bucket triggers a Lambda function each time an object is uploaded and the function uploads an object to the bucket, then the function indirectly triggers itself.

Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function improves scalability and reliability, and is best practice design for modern applications. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple and coordinate the components of a cloud application. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/sqs-message-lifecycle-diagram.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The number of messages in your Amazon SQS queue does not solely define the number of instances needed. In fact, the number of instances in the fleet can be driven by multiple factors, including how long it takes to process a message and the acceptable amount of latency (queue delay).</p><p>The solution is to use a <em>backlog per instance</em> metric with the target value being the <em>acceptable backlog per instance</em> to maintain. You can calculate these numbers as follows:</p><p><strong>Backlog per instance</strong>: To determine your backlog per instance, start with the Amazon SQS metric <code>ApproximateNumberOfMessages</code> to determine the length of the SQS queue (number of messages available for retrieval from the queue). Divide that number by the fleet's running capacity, which for an Auto Scaling group is the number of instances in the <code>InService</code> state, to get the backlog per instance.</p><p><strong>Acceptable backlog per instance</strong>: To determine your target value, first calculate what your application can accept in terms of latency. Then, take the acceptable latency value and divide it by the average time that an EC2 instance takes to process a message.</p><p>To illustrate with an example, let's say that the current <code>ApproximateNumberOfMessages</code> is 1500 and the fleet's running capacity is 10. If the average processing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and the longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds then the acceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, which equals 100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy. Because the backlog per instance is currently at 150 (1500 / 10), your fleet scales out by five instances to maintain proportion to the target value.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong><em>Use an Amazon SQS queue to decouple the application components and scale-out the EC2 instances based upon the </em></strong><code><strong><em>ApproximateNumberOfMessages</em></strong></code><strong><em> metric in Amazon CloudWatch</em>.</strong></p><p><strong><em>Replacing the Auto Scaling group with a cluster placement group to achieve a low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication </em></strong>is incorrect because although it is true that a cluster placement group allows you to achieve a low-latency network performance, you still need to use Auto Scaling for your architecture to add more EC2 instances.</p><p><strong><em>Using larger instances for your application with an attached Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)</em></strong><em> </em>is incorrect because using a larger EC2 instance would not prevent data from being lost in case of a larger spike. You can take advantage of the durability and elasticity of SQS to keep the messages available for consumption by your instances. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS.</p><p><strong><em>Setting up Amazon Aurora Serverless for on-demand, auto-scaling configuration of your EC2 Instances and also enabling Amazon Aurora Parallel Query feature for faster analytical queries over your current data</em></strong><em> </em>is incorrect because although the Amazon Aurora Parallel Query feature provides faster analytical queries over your current data, Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for your database, and NOT for your EC2 instances. This is actually an auto-scaling configuration for your Amazon Aurora database and not for your compute services.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon SQS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-sqs/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-sqs/</a></p></div>"

You can make a default subnet into a private subnet by removing the route from the destination 0.0.0.0/0 to the internet gateway. However, if you do this, any EC2 instance running in that subnet can't access the internet.</p><p>Instances that you launch into a default subnet receive both a public IPv4 address and a private IPv4 address, and both public and private DNS hostnames. Instances that you launch into a nondefault subnet in a default VPC don't receive a public IPv4 address or a DNS hostname. You can change your subnet's default public IP addressing behavior</p><p>By default, nondefault subnets have the IPv4 public addressing attribute set to <code><strong>false</strong></code>, and default subnets have this attribute set to <code><strong>true</strong></code>. An exception is a nondefault subnet created by the Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard — the wizard sets the attribute to <code><strong>true</strong></code>.</p><p>In this scenario, it is possible that the fifth EC2 instance launched in a nondefault subnet doesn't have a public IP address or an Elastic IP address, just like the first 4 instances.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/default-vpc-diagram.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Associating an Elastic IP address to the fifth EC2 instance</em></strong> is correct because the fifth instance does not have a public IP address since it was deployed on a nondefault subnet. The other 4 instances are accessible over the Internet because they each have an Elastic IP address attached, unlike the last instance which only has a private IP address. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the Internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the Internet.</p><p><strong><em>Including the fifth EC2 instance to the Placement Group of the other four EC2 instances and enabling Enhanced Networking</em></strong> is incorrect because Placement Groups is primarily used to determine how your instances are placed on the underlying hardware while Enhanced Networking, on the other hand, is for providing high-performance networking capabilities using single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) on supported EC2 instance types.</p><p><strong><em>Setting up a NAT gateway to allow access to the fifth EC2 instance</em></strong> is incorrect because you do not need a NAT Gateway nor a NAT instance in this scenario considering that the instances are already in <em>public</em> subnet. Remember that a NAT Gateway or a NAT instance is primarily used to enable instances in a <strong><em>private</em></strong> subnet to connect to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those instances.</p><p><strong><em>Enabling AWS Transfer for SFTP to allow the incoming traffic to the fifth EC2 Instance instance</em></strong> is incorrect because AWS Transfer for SFTP (AWS SFTP) is simply a fully managed AWS service that enables you to transfer files over Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) storage.

Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your function to the VPC to access private resources during execution.</p><p>AWS Lambda runs your function code securely within a VPC by default. However, to enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC.</p><p>Lambda functions cannot connect directly to a VPC with dedicated instance tenancy. To connect to resources in a dedicated VPC, peer it to a second VPC with default tenancy.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Your Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, you must make sure that your VPC has sufficient ENI capacity to support the scale requirements of your Lambda function. It is also recommended that you specify at least one subnet in each Availability Zone in your Lambda function configuration.</p><p>By specifying subnets in each of the Availability Zones, your Lambda function can run in another Availability Zone if one goes down or runs out of IP addresses. If your VPC does not have sufficient ENIs or subnet IPs, your Lambda function will not scale as requests increase, and you will see an increase in invocation errors with EC2 error types like <code>EC2ThrottledException</code>.

Take note that the scenario says that the issue is happening only on certain times of the day, which means that the issue is only intermittent and the function works at other times. We can also conclude that an availability issue is not an issue since the application is already using a highly available NAT Gateway and not just a NAT instance.</p><p>The option that says:<em> </em><strong><em>The associated security group of your function does not allow outbound connections</em></strong> is incorrect because if the associated security group does not allow outbound connections then the Lambda function will not work at all in the first place.

In addition, Internet traffic restrictions do not usually produce <code>EC2ThrottledException</code> errors.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>The attached IAM execution role of your function does not have the necessary permissions to access the resources of your VPC</em></strong> is incorrect because just as what is explained above, the issue is intermittent and thus, the IAM execution role of the function does have the necessary permissions to access the resources of the VPC since it works at those specific times.

This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.</p><p>You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can also be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances.</p><p>For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections; applications can connect to a read replica just as they would to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com/redactor/raw/2020-02-28_01-52-40-4fa2635076a98c44c28464d31d793a21.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>When you create a read replica for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, Amazon RDS sets up a secure communications channel using public-key encryption between the source DB instance and the read replica, even when replicating across regions. Amazon RDS establishes any AWS security configurations such as adding security group entries needed to enable the secure channel.</p><p>You can also create read replicas within a Region or between Regions for your Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database instances encrypted at rest with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- <em>It elastically scales out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>- Provides asynchronous replication and improves the performance of the primary database by taking read-heavy database workloads from it.</em></strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Allows both read and write operations on the read replica to complement the primary database</em></strong> is incorrect as Read Replicas are primarily used to offload read-only operations from the primary database instance. By default, you can't do a write operation to your Read Replica.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> <em>Provides synchronous replication and automatic failover in the case of Availability Zone service failures</em></strong> is incorrect as this is a benefit of Multi-AZ and not of a Read Replica. Moreover, Read Replicas provide an asynchronous type of replication and not synchronous replication.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> <em>It enhances the read performance of your primary database by increasing its IOPS and accelerates its query processing via AWS Global Accelerator</em></strong> is incorrect because Read Replicas do not do anything to upgrade or increase the read throughput on the primary DB instance per se, but it provides a way for your application to fetch data from replicas. In this way, it improves the overall performance of your entire database-tier (and not just the primary DB instance). It doesn't increase the IOPS nor use AWS Global Accelerator to accelerate the compute capacity of your primary database. AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service, not related to RDS, that direct user traffic to the nearest application endpoint to the client, thus reducing internet latency and jitter. It simply routes the traffic to the closest edge location via Anycast.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon RDS Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-relational-database-service-amazon-rds/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-relational-database-service-amazon-rds/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional tutorial - How do I make my RDS MySQL read replica writable?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/j5da6d2TIPc\">https://youtu.be/j5da6d2TIPc</a></p></div>"

Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs.</p><p>AWS Lambda scales your functions automatically on your behalf.

You can just simply upload the certificates to the ALB and use SNI to handle multiple domains in a cost-effective manner.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-https-dedicated-ip-or-sni.html#cnames-https-dedicated-ip\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-https-dedicated-ip-or-sni.html#cnames-https-dedicated-ip</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon CloudFront Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-cloudfront/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-cloudfront/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SNI Custom SSL vs Dedicated IP Custom SSL:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-sni-custom-ssl-vs-dedicated-ip-custom-ssl/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-sni-custom-ssl-vs-dedicated-ip-custom-ssl/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Comparison of AWS Services Cheat Sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/comparison-of-aws-services-for-udemy-students/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/comparison-of-aws-services-for-udemy-students/</a></p></div>"

This option is recommended if you must manage both ends of the VPN connection either for compliance purposes or for leveraging gateway devices that are not currently supported by Amazon VPC’s VPN solution.</p><p>You can create an IPsec VPN connection between your VPC and your remote network. On the AWS side of the VPN connection, a <em>virtual private gateway</em> provides two VPN endpoints (tunnels) for automatic failover. You configure your <em>customer gateway</em> on the remote side of the VPN connection. If you have more than one remote network (for example, multiple branch offices), you can create multiple AWS managed VPN connections via your virtual private gateway to enable communication between these networks.</p><p>With AWS Site-to-Site VPN, you can connect to an Amazon VPC in the cloud the same way you connect to your branches.

A VPN connection actually goes through the public Internet, unlike the AWS Direct Connect connection which has a direct and dedicated connection to your on-premises network.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>It provides a networking connection between two VPCs which enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses</strong> is incorrect because this actually describes VPC Peering and not a VPN connection.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>It enables you to establish a private and dedicated network connection between your network and your VPC</strong> is incorrect because this is the advantage of an AWS Direct Connect connection and not a VPN.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpn-connections.html\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpn-connections.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/software-vpn-network-to-amazon.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/software-vpn-network-to-amazon.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon VPC Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-vpc/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-vpc/</a></p></div>"
