A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.</p><p>IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html\">GetUser</a> action, then a user with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. When you create an IAM user, you can choose to allow console or programmatic access. If console access is allowed, the IAM user can sign in to the console using a user name and password. Or if programmatic access is allowed, the user can use access keys to work with the CLI or API.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://dmhnzl5mp9mj6.cloudfront.net/security_awsblog/images/CC_Diagram1_0717.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Based on the provided IAM policy, the user is only allowed to get, write and list all of the objects for the 'tutorialsdojo' s3 bucket.

It does mean that the more distinct partition key values that your workload accesses, the more those requests will be spread across the partitioned space.

The client uses the master key only to encrypt the data encryption key that it generates randomly. The process works like this:</p><p>1. The Amazon S3 encryption client generates a one-time-use symmetric key (also known as a data encryption key or data key) locally. It uses the data key to encrypt the data of a single Amazon S3 object. The client generates a separate data key for each object.</p><p>2. The client encrypts the data encryption key using the master key that you provide. The client uploads the encrypted data key and its material description as part of the object metadata. The client uses the material description to determine which client-side master key to use for decryption.</p><p>3. The client uploads the encrypted data to Amazon S3 and saves the encrypted data key as object metadata (<code>x-amz-meta-x-amz-key</code>) in Amazon S3.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>When downloading an object - </strong>The client downloads the encrypted object from Amazon S3. Using the material description from the object's metadata, the client determines which master key to use to decrypt the data key.

The scenario clearly indicates that both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS.</p><p><strong>Using S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key</strong> is incorrect because the scenario mentioned that the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS, which means that you have to use client-side encryption in order to encrypt the data first before sending to AWS. In this way, you can ensure that there is no unencrypted data being uploaded to AWS. In addition, the master key used by Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS–Managed Keys (SSE-KMS) is uploaded and managed by AWS, which directly violates the requirement of not uploading the master key.</p><p><strong>Using S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key</strong> is incorrect because just as mentioned above, you have to use client-side encryption in this scenario instead of server-side encryption. For the S3 server-side encryption with customer-provided key (SSE-C), you actually provide the encryption key as part of your request to upload the object to S3.

Each connection is handled by a specific DB instance. When you connect to an Aurora cluster, the host name and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an <em>endpoint</em>. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don't have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available.</p><p>For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different roles. For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query traffic.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com/redactor/raw/2019-04-03_00-40-18-850e58ca7802358579be53729bfc0cbb.gif\"></p><p><br></p><p>Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate instance or group of instances based on your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.</p><p>The custom endpoint provides load-balanced database connections based on criteria other than the read-only or read-write capability of the DB instances. For example, you might define a custom endpoint to connect to instances that use a particular AWS instance class or a particular DB parameter group. Then you might tell particular groups of users about this custom endpoint. For example, you might direct internal users to low-capacity instances for report generation or ad hoc (one-time) querying, and direct production traffic to high-capacity instances. Hence, <strong>creating a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and another custom endpoint to handle the reporting queries</strong> is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>Configuring your application to use the reader endpoint for both production traffic and reporting queries, which will enable your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas</strong> is incorrect because although it is true that a reader endpoint enables your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas, it is quite limited to doing read operations only. You still need to use a custom endpoint to load-balance the database connections based on the specified criteria.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>In your application, use the instance endpoint of your Aurora database to handle the incoming production traffic and use the cluster endpoint to handle reporting queries</strong> is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) for an Aurora DB cluster simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint can perform write operations in the database such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handling production traffic but not suitable for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database operations that will be sent. Moreover, the endpoint does not point to lower-capacity or high-capacity instances as per the requirement. A better solution for this is to use a custom endpoint.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Do nothing since by default, Aurora will automatically direct the production traffic to your high-capacity instances and the reporting queries to your low-capacity instances</strong> is incorrect because Aurora does not do this by default.

An Aurora Serverless DB cluster is a DB cluster that automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales up or down its compute capacity based on your application's needs. Aurora Serverless provides a relatively simple, cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, sporadic or unpredictable workloads. It can provide this because it automatically starts up, scales compute capacity to match your application's usage and shuts down when it's not in use.</p><p>Take note that a non-Serverless DB cluster for Aurora is called a provisioned DB cluster. Aurora Serverless clusters and provisioned clusters both have the same kind of high-capacity, distributed, and highly available storage volume.</p><p>When you work with Amazon Aurora without Aurora Serverless (provisioned DB clusters), you can choose your DB instance class size and create Aurora Replicas to increase read throughput. If your workload changes, you can modify the DB instance class size and change the number of Aurora Replicas. This model works well when the database workload is predictable, because you can adjust capacity manually based on the expected workload.</p><p>However, in some environments, workloads can be intermittent and unpredictable. There can be periods of heavy workloads that might last only a few minutes or hours, and also long periods of light activity, or even no activity. Some examples are retail websites with intermittent sales events, reporting databases that produce reports when needed, development and testing environments, and new applications with uncertain requirements. In these cases and many others, it can be difficult to configure the correct capacity at the right times. It can also result in higher costs when you pay for capacity that isn't used.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-serverless-arch.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>With Aurora Serverless , you can create a database endpoint without specifying the DB instance class size. You set the minimum and maximum capacity. With Aurora Serverless, the database endpoint connects to a<em> proxy fleet </em>that routes the workload to a fleet of resources that are automatically scaled. Because of the proxy fleet, connections are continuous as Aurora Serverless scales the resources automatically based on the minimum and maximum capacity specifications. Database client applications don't need to change to use the proxy fleet. Aurora Serverless manages the connections automatically. Scaling is rapid because it uses a pool of \"warm\" resources that are always ready to service requests. Storage and processing are separate, so you can scale down to zero processing and pay only for storage.</p><p>Aurora Serverless introduces a new <code>serverless</code> DB engine mode for Aurora DB clusters. Non-Serverless DB clusters use the <code>provisioned</code> DB engine mode.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong><em>Launch an Amazon Aurora Serverless DB cluster then set the minimum and maximum capacity for the cluster</em>.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch an Amazon Aurora Provisioned DB cluster with burstable performance DB instance class types</em></strong> is incorrect because an Aurora Provisioned DB cluster is not suitable for intermittent, sporadic, and unpredictable transactional workloads. This model works well when the database workload is predictable because you can adjust capacity manually based on the expected workload. A better database setup here is to use an Amazon Aurora Serverless cluster.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a DynamoDB Global table with Auto Scaling enabled</em></strong> is incorrect because although it is using Auto Scaling, the scenario explicitly indicated that you need a relational database to handle your transactional workloads. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and is not suitable for this use case. Moreover, the use of a DynamoDB Global table is not warranted since this is primarily used if you need a fully managed, multi-region, and multi-master database that provides fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch an Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster with Concurrency Scaling</em></strong> is incorrect because this type of database is primarily used for online analytical processing (OLAP) and not for online transactional processing (OLTP). Concurrency Scaling is simply an Amazon Redshift feature that automatically and elastically scales query processing power of your Redshift cluster to provide consistently fast performance for hundreds of concurrent queries.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html</a></p></div>"

This is known as the <em>single sign-on</em> (SSO) approach to temporary access.

Amazon WorkDocs is simply a fully managed, secure content creation, storage, and collaboration service. With Amazon WorkDocs, you can easily create, edit, and share content. And because it’s stored centrally on AWS, you can access it from anywhere on any device.</p><p><strong><em>Setting up a matching IAM user for each of the 1200 users in your corporate directory that needs access to a folder in the S3 bucket</em></strong> is incorrect since creating that many IAM users would be unnecessary.

Basically, the english definition of a schema is: <em>a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model</em>.</p><p>Just think of a schema as the \"structure\" or a \"model\" of your data in your database. Since the scenario requires that the schema, or the structure of your data, changes frequently, then you have to pick a database which provides a non-rigid and flexible way of adding or removing new types of data. This is a classic example of choosing between a relational database and non-relational (NoSQL) database.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com/redactor/raw/2019-03-08_21-57-30-7860e883ac634eb2e771a5f4694cbafa.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>A relational database is known for having a rigid schema, with a lot of constraints and limits as to which (and what type of ) data can be inserted or not. It is primarily used for scenarios where you have to support complex queries which fetch data across a number of tables. It is best for scenarios where you have complex table relationships but for use cases where you need to have a flexible schema, this is not a suitable database to use.</p><p>For NoSQL, it is not as rigid as a relational database because you can easily add or remove rows or elements in your table/collection entry. It also has a more flexible schema because it can store complex hierarchical data within a single item which, unlike a relational database, does not entail changing multiple related tables. Hence, the best answer to be used here is a NoSQL database, like DynamoDB. When your business requires a low-latency response to high-traffic queries, taking advantage of a NoSQL system generally makes technical and economic sense.</p><p>Amazon DynamoDB helps solve the problems that limit the relational system scalability by avoiding them.

        "explain": "<h4>Explanation</h4><div data-purpose=\"safely-set-inner-html:mc-quiz-question:question-explanation\"><p>A file gateway supports a file interface into Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and combines a service and a virtual software appliance. By using this combination, you can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB). The software appliance, or gateway, is deployed into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/file-gateway-concepts-diagram.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points. With a file gateway, you can do the following:</p><p>- You can store and retrieve files directly using the NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol.</p><p>- You can store and retrieve files directly using the SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol.</p><p>- You can access your data directly in Amazon S3 from any AWS Cloud application or service.</p><p>- You can manage your Amazon S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. You can think of a file gateway as a file system mount on S3.</p><p>AWS Storage Gateway supports the Amazon S3 Standard, Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access and Amazon Glacier storage classes. When you create or update a file share, you have the option to select a storage class for your objects. You can either choose the Amazon S3 Standard or any of the infrequent access storage classes such as S3 Standard IA or S3 One Zone IA. Objects stored in any of these storage classes can be transitioned to Amazon Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy.</p><p>Although you can write objects directly from a file share to the S3-Standard-IA or S3-One Zone-IA storage class, it is recommended that you use a Lifecycle Policy to transition your objects rather than write directly from the file share, especially if you're expecting to update or delete the object within 30 days of archiving it.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong><em>Launch a new file gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the file gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for data archival.</em></strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a new tape gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the tape gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival</em></strong> is incorrect because although tape gateways provide cost-effective and durable archive backup data in Amazon Glacier, it does not meet the criteria of being retrievable immediately within minutes. It also doesn't maintain a local cache that provides low latency access to the recently accessed data and reduce data egress charges. Thus, it is still better to set up a file gateway instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Establish a Direct Connect connection to integrate your on-premises network to your VPC. Upload the documents on Amazon EBS Volumes and use a lifecycle policy to automatically move the EBS snapshots to an S3 bucket, and then later to Glacier for archival</em></strong> is incorrect because EBS Volumes are not as durable compared with S3 and it would be more cost-efficient if you directly store the documents to an S3 bucket. An alternative solution is to use AWS Direct Connect with AWS Storage Gateway to create a connection for high-throughput workload needs, providing a dedicated network connection between your on-premises file gateway and AWS. But this solution is using EBS, hence, this option is still wrong.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Use AWS Snowmobile to migrate all of the files from the on-premises network. Upload the documents to an S3 bucket and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival</em></strong> is incorrect because Snowmobile is mainly used to migrate the entire data of an on-premises data center to AWS. This is not a suitable approach as the company still has a hybrid cloud architecture which means that they will still use their on-premises data center along with their AWS cloud infrastructure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/StorageGatewayConcepts.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/StorageGatewayConcepts.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-s3/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-s3/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/</a></p></div>"

Hence, <strong>creating an Oracle database in RDS with Multi-AZ deployments</strong> is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>Launching an Oracle database instance in RDS with Recovery Manager (RMAN) enabled</strong> and <strong>launching an Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) in RDS</strong> are incorrect because Oracle RMAN and RAC are not supported in RDS.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Convert the database schema using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and AWS Database Migration Service.

One important thing to remember here is that Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account.</p><p>When your computing needs change, you can modify your Standard or Convertible Reserved Instances and continue to take advantage of the billing benefit. You can modify the Availability Zone, scope, network platform, or instance size (within the same instance type) of your Reserved Instance. You can also sell your unused instance on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Reserved Instances don't get interrupted unlike Spot instances in the event that there are not enough unused EC2 instances to meet the demand</strong> is correct. Likewise, the option that says: <strong>You can have capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term through Scheduled Reserved Instances</strong> is correct. You reserve the capacity in advance, so that you know it is available when you need it. You pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do not use them.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Standard Reserved Instances can be later exchanged for other Convertible Reserved Instances</strong> is incorrect because only Convertible Reserved Instances can be exchanged for other Convertible Reserved Instances.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>It can enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones and multiple AWS Regions for any duration</strong> is incorrect because you can reserve capacity to a specific AWS Region (regional Reserved Instance) or specific Availability Zone (zonal Reserved Instance) only. You cannot reserve capacity to multiple AWS Regions in a single RI purchase.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>It runs in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer</strong> is incorrect because that is the description of a Dedicated instance and not a Reserved Instance. A Dedicated instance runs in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modifying.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modifying.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/reserved-instances-types.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/reserved-instances-types.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon EC2 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2/\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2/</a></p></div>"

The functions run in response to CloudFront events, without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Lambda functions to change CloudFront requests and responses at the following points:</p><p>- After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)</p><p>- Before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin (origin request)</p><p>- After CloudFront receives the response from the origin (origin response)</p><p>- Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images/cloudfront-events-that-trigger-lambda-functions.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>In the given scenario, you can use Lambda@Edge to allow your Lambda functions to customize the content that CloudFront delivers and to execute the authentication process in AWS locations closer to the users. In addition, you can set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins with one as the primary origin and the other as the second origin which CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin fails.

Therefore, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Customize the content that the CloudFront web distribution delivers to your users using Lambda@Edge, which allows your Lambda functions to execute the authentication process in AWS locations closer to the users.</strong></p><p><strong>- Set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins.

Although setting up multiple VPCs across various regions which are connected with a transit VPC is valid, this solution still entails higher setup and maintenance costs.

You can improve your cache performance by increasing the proportion of your viewer requests that are served from CloudFront edge caches instead of going to your origin servers for content. However, take note that the problem in the scenario is the sluggish authentication process of your global users and not just the caching of the static objects.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Deploy your application to multiple AWS regions to accommodate your users around the world. Set up a Route 53 record with latency routing policy to route incoming traffic to the region that provides the best latency to the user</strong> is incorrect because although this may resolve the performance issue, this solution entails a significant implementation cost since you have to deploy your application to multiple AWS regions.
